# bash-object
The goal is to create and use objects in bash. The elements of a bash-object are written in bash. Therefore you can use them everywhere, even in cygwin.

## Version
The current stable version is 0.9 (2021-08-13)

## Usage
You can use them in any bash script.  
You can load the obj command into memory: in the **.bashrc** file, type the following line:  
`source <path-to>/obj`  
The obj command loads other parts of the bash-object if they have not been loaded.
