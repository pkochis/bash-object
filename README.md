# bash-object
The goal is to create and use objects in bash. The elements of a bash-object are written in bash. Therefore you can use them everywhere, even in cygwin.

## Features
The system implements classes and objects. Classes are organized in a tree structure, but a class can inherit properties from other branches of the tree. An automatic help system and language handler are built into the system.
The package includes some classes and objects to aid development.

## Version
The current stable version is 1.0 (2021-08-31)

## Usage
You can load the obj command into memory: in the **.bashrc** file, type the following line:  
`source <path-to>/obj`
The `obj` command loads other parts of the bash-object if they have not been loaded.

## Help
All operations can be performed via the `obj` command. The necessary information can be found in the help system. The central help system tab can be displayed with the `obj --help` command.
