# bash-object
The goal is to create and use objects in bash.
All elements of a bash-object are written in bash. Therefore you can use this scripts everywhere, even in cygwin.

## Version
The current stable version is 0.9.6 (2021-08-25)

## Usage
The objects can be used in any bash script.  
The obj command can be loaded into memory: in the **.bashrc** file, type the following line:  
`source <path-to>/obj`.  
The obj command loads other parts of the bash object if they are not already loaded.

## Help
Help is available with the following command:
`obj --help`
