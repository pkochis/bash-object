# bash-object
The goal is create &amp; use objects in bash. All scrips are written in bash. Therefore you can use them everywhere, even in cygwin.

## Usage
You can use them in any bash-script: first call the **loader** and use the **objInit** command.  
You can load the objInit in memory: add the following line to the **.bashrc** file:  
`source <path-to>/loader`  
In this case you can use only objInit command in scripts. It will load other parts if them was not loaded.
